* Org Agenda - adding multiple files
    Open your Emacs configuration file (typically ~/.emacs or ~/.emacs.d/init.el).
    Set the org-agenda-files variable to a list of folders or Org files you want included in the agenda. For example:
(setq org-agenda-files '(
  "~/org/project1/"
  "~/org/project2/"
  "~/org/tasks.org"
  "~/org/notes.org"
))
If you have a folder structure, you can use a wildcard to include all .org files in a folder:
    (setq org-agenda-files '(
      "~/org/project1/*.org"
      "~/org/project2/*.org"
    ))
