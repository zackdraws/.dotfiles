To add multiple folders to your Org Agenda in Emacs, you can configure the org-agenda-files variable to include all the directories (folders) where your Org files are located. Here's how you can do it:



    Open your Emacs configuration file (typically ~/.emacs or ~/.emacs.d/init.el).



    Set the org-agenda-files variable to a list of folders or Org files you want included in the agenda. For example:



(setq org-agenda-files '(

  "~/org/project1/"

  "~/org/project2/"

  "~/org/tasks.org"

  "~/org/notes.org"

))



In this example:



    ~/org/project1/ and ~/org/project2/ are folders that contain Org files.

    ~/org/tasks.org and ~/org/notes.org are specific Org files.



If you have a folder structure, you can use a wildcard to include all .org files in a folder:



    (setq org-agenda-files '(

      "~/org/project1/*.org"

      "~/org/project2/*.org"

    ))



    Reload your Emacs configuration by either restarting Emacs or evaluating the modified config file.



    To evaluate the config file, you can use M-x eval-buffer if you're in the config file buffer, or M-x eval-expression with (load-file "~/.emacs.d/init.el").



Once set, Org Agenda will include all files from those folders when you open the agenda with C-c a a or other agenda commands.
