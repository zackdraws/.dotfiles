#+title: Yazi Notes
** main differences between my yazi and the default
*** File handling
- I tried to have it so that I could open tvpaint files from terminal but it doesn't work too well from linux to windows
[file_handlers]
"tvpp" = "~/.open_tvpaint.sh"
*** For using emacs
I changed the editor to be emacs-nw
[opener]
edit = [
{ run = '${EDITOR=-emacs-nw} "$0"', desc =$EDITOR". block = true, for - "unix" }.
{ run = 'code "%*"', orphan = true, desc = "code", for = "windows" },
{ run = 'code -w "%*"', block = true, desc = "code (block)", for = "windwows" },
*** also here
open = [
]
    { run = 'cd "$(dirname "$1")" && emacs -nw "$1"', desc = "$EDITOR", block = true, for = "unix" },
