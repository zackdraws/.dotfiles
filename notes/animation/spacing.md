# spacing
- timing and spacing is one of the animation principle.
- space out and time your drawings to for different actions and results.
# ways to animate
- pose to pose
pose to pose drawing first drawing and the next key pose and then breakdown those key drawings and then in-between those key poses.
use timing charts to plan breakdown drawings and in-betweens 
notches that are closer together represent poses being closer to each other.
- straight ahead
Animating going straight ahead and drawing one drawing after another. 
Types of Arcs -
 draw these arcs as shorthands for what the movement will be like
- arc - arcs are more natural movements- more curves and more smooth 
- sawtooth arc - more robotic quick movements 
- cubic or pointy - in-between robotic and natural 
- spline arc - smooth arc movements
- even spacing - more even actions
- favor the drawing based on the importance of the drawings
