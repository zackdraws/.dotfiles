draw first drawing
next key drawing or last drawing
drawing the major break down of those two poses
chart the spacing of those poses
start drawing breakdowns and keys

timing chart
notches that are closer together represent poses being closer to each other

types of arcs
draw these arcs as shorthands for what the movement will be like

- arc - arcs are more natural movements- more curves and more smooth 
- sawtooth arc - more robotic quick movements 
- cubic or pointy - in-between robotic and natural 
- spline arc - smooth arc movements
- even spacing - more even actions
- favor the drawing based on the importance of the drawings
