to write text to a file
echo "text" >> filename.org

```bash
cat >> my_notes.org
echo "This is another line in the file."

**5. Writing Variables (Bash Scripting)**

If you're writing text from a script, you'll likely use variables:

```bash
TEXT="This is the text to write."
echo "$TEXT" >> filename.org
```

* **`TEXTe="This is the text to write."`**:  This assigns the string "This is the text to write." to the variable `TEXT`.
* **`echo "$TEXT"`**:  This expands the variable `TEXT` and prints its value.  The double quotes around `$TEXT` are
important to prevent the shell from interpreting any special characters in the variable's value.
