First impressions on Toonboom Harmony 
I like the shortcut to move around layers being h and j \
It's not intuitive program, not that\'92s a bad thing. 
I had to read the manual and all the new keyboard shortcuts 
and I still don\'92t know a lot of the program. 
But a lot of it just is not intuitive.
 Especially the light table. 
There isn\'92t really and easy flow to it, 
especially for just doing rough animation 
The vector tools though and layer management is pretty good. 
Especially having vector options available. 
But I wish there was an easy system to bookmarking drawings.
Something easier than assigning key drawings.
