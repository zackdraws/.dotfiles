1. Sequential Execution (Unconditional):

    Semicolon (;): commands one after another, regardless of whether the previous command succeeded or failed. 

    command1; command2; command3

2. Conditional Execution:

    Logical AND (&&): works only if the preceding command completed successfully (exited with a zero status code). 

Code

    command1 && command2 && command3

    Logical OR (||): This operator executes the subsequent command only if the preceding command failed (exited with a non-zero status code). 

Code

    command1 || command2 || command3

3. Command Grouping:

    Parentheses (): Commands enclosed in parentheses are executed in a subshell, meaning any changes to the environment (like variable assignments) within the parentheses will not affect the parent shell. 

Code

    (command1; command2) && command3

    Braces {}: Commands enclosed in braces are executed in the current shell context. Note that a space is required after the opening brace and before the closing brace, and a semicolon or newline is required after the last command before the closing brace. 

Code

    { command1; command2; } && command3

4. Multiline Commands:

    Backslash (`\`): A backslash at the end of a line indicates that the command continues on the next line. This is useful for improving readability of long commands. 

Code

    long_command_part1 \

    --option1 value1 \

    --option2 value2
