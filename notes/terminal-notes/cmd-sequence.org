Semicolon (;): commands one after another
Logical AND (&&): works only if the preceding command completes
Logical OR (||): This operator executes if the preceding command failed (exited with a non-zero status code). 
Parentheses (): Commands enclosed in parentheses are executed in a subshell, meaning any changes to the environment (like variable assignments) within the parentheses will not affect the parent shell. (command1; command2) && command3
Braces {}: Commands enclosed in braces are executed in the current shell context. Note that a space is required after the opening brace and before the closing brace, and a semicolon or newline is required after the last command before the closing brace. 
{ command1; command2; } && command3
Backslash (`\`): A backslash at the end of a line indicates that the command continues on the next line. This is useful for improving readability of long commands.
