Scott embraced the arrival of digital filmmaking tools and used them to enhance his work, with rapid-fire editing and amplified color tones bringing the most out of his action thrillers.</p>\n<p id=\"5D18m6\">This era also saw Scott repeatedly work with Denzel Washington, and the two never missed. In addition to <em>Man on Fire </em>and <em>Unstoppable</em>, the two collaborated on the sci-fi thriller <em>Deja Vu </em>and this remake of the 1974 classic train heist movie.</p>\n<p id=\"tPqU04\">Washington stars as subway dispatcher Walter Garber, who finds himself as the negotiator in an ongoing hostage crisis on board the titular train. John Travolta is appropriately unhinged as the lead hijacker, and the movie has a sprawling cast that features John Turturro (NYPD’s hostage negotiator, who Travolta rejects in favor of Washington’s Garber), Luis Guzmán, and James Gandolfini, among many others.</p>\n<p id=\"mLzleK\">The movie features some <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23279231/best-action-scenes-train-fights-watch\">great train action scenes</a>, but the highlight is the interplay between Washington and Travolta, both at their very best in this cat-and-mouse thriller. —<em>Pete Volk</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"UYDayr\"><strong>I See You</strong></h2>\n<div class=\"c-wide-block\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"A man wearing a terrifying frog mask in a black hoodie in I See You.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lwf19DYhD6DRKkiNL8icgZrGLzI=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24565945/image_w1280.jpg\">\n      <cite>Image: Saban Films</cite>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n<p id=\"UgBA8E\"><strong>Year:</strong> 2019<br><strong>Run time:</strong> 1h 38m<br><strong>Director:</strong> Adam Randall<br><strong>Cast</strong>: Helen Hunt, Jon Tenney, Owen Teague</p>\n<p id=\"g311vm\">This 2019 psychological thriller centers on the life of the Harper family: Jackie (Helen Hunt), a successful psychologist; Greg (Jon Tenney), a police detective and Jackie’s husband; and Connor (Judah Lewis), Jackie and Greg’s teenage son. After Jackie’s infidelity with another man is revealed, the Harpers struggle to rebuild their lives together. While this is happening, Greg is brought on to investigate a series of mysterious and violent kidnappings linked to a rash of similar incidents dating back several years prior. </p>\n<p id=\"Fe8K1Z\">As Greg’s investigation advances, the Harpers are menaced by a mysterious vandal with knowledge not only of their deepest secrets and whereabouts, but apparent access to their home. Who is this masked assailant, and what is their connection to these recent disappearances? Where <em>I See You</em> may suffer from occasionally wooden performances and admittedly subpar pacing, it excels in contorting its relatively simple premise into increasingly macabre and surprising new shapes. If you’re looking for a murder mystery drama/slow-burn cerebral home invasion thriller with unsettling found-footage elements à la Michael Haneke’s <em>Caché</em>, <em>I See You</em> is the perfect choice. <em>—Toussaint Egan</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"zPh083\"><strong>Psycho</strong></h2>\n<div class=\"c-wide-block\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"A woman (Janet Leigh) behind the wheel of an automobile in Psycho.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_Yud2oEY57Zr4F8aFjr6DHvt7ww=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24565949/11__844_.jpg\">\n      <cite>Image: Universal Pictures Home Entertainment</cite>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n<p id=\"pJY3Be\"><strong>Year: </strong>1960<br><strong>Run time: </strong>1h 49m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Alfred Hitchcock<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles, John Gavin</p>\n<p id=\"rj4N3V\">What could possibly be said about Alfred Hitchcock’s 1960 psychological horror thriller that hasn’t already been said before several times over? <em>Psycho</em> is an undisputed masterpiece, the crown jewel in a filmography of a director with no shortage of cinematic gems, a film so iconic and widely referenced and parodied by countless other films and television series, the thought that anyone could go without recognizing it feels all but impossible. </p>\n<p id=\"x7WTLm\">The film stars Vera Miles and John Gavin as Lila Crane and Sam Loomis, the sister and lover respectively of Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), a would-be embezzler on the run after stealing $40,000 from her job as a bank teller. Investigating her disappearance, Lila and Sam track Marion’s last-known whereabouts to a motel run by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and his mother. To say anything more would be to spoil the plot. If you somehow have never seen or heard about <em>Psycho</em>, stop what you’re doing and make it your priority to watch this film. <em>—TE</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"TOOLdS\"><strong>Side Effects</strong></h2>\n<div class=\"c-wide-block\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aQJUetnVQ1GADtBsxB33F0T2oek=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24559825/side_effects_jude_law.jpg\">\n      <cite>Image: Endgame Entertainment/Open Road Films</cite>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n<p id=\"pkoYEI\"><strong>Year:</strong> 2013<br><strong>Run time:</strong> 1h 46m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Steven Soderbergh<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Rooney Mara, Jude Law, Channing Tatum</p>\n<p id=\"xeg7KZ\">Now, from a Hitchcock classic to a Hitchcock-inspired modern classic.</p>\n<p id=\"NlTQ5A\">Before making movies with his iPhone, and before his “retirement” from directing, Steven Soderbergh made this captivating psychological thriller about the pharmaceutical industry, written by his frequent collaborator Scott Z. Burns (<em>Contagion</em>). </p>\n<p id=\"ShzjcA\">In<em> Side Effects</em>, Emily (Rooney Mara) a wealthy woman whose husband (Channing Tatum) recently got out of prison after a bid for insider trading. After attempting to take her own life, Emily is prescribed an experimental drug by a pair of psychiatrists (Jude Law and Catherine Zeta-Jones), with shocking... side effects.</p>\n<p id=\"McJgoE\">Soderbergh’s most Hitchcockian movie (at least until <em>Kimi</em>), <em>Side Effects</em> is a clever thriller with great central performances (especially Mara, who is fantastic in a great addition to the “a person has an extremely bad time” film canon) and plenty of twists to keep viewers guessing. It’s also the kind of movie that rewards rewatches — if you’ve already seen it, now’s a good opportunity to revisit it. —<em>PV</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"91ZFiP\"><strong>The Guilty</strong></h2>\n<div class=\"c-wide-block\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"JAKE GYLLENHAAL with a headset at a 9-1-1 computer bay in The Guilty\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d3VmROJki21OVFlxXUYSjLAwHWg=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22891221/The_Guilty_00_06_53_12_R.jpg\">\n      <cite>Image: Netflix</cite>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n<p id=\"OIhuvq\"><strong>Year:</strong> 2021<br><strong>Run time:</strong> 1h 30m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Antoine Fuqua<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Jake Gyllenhaal, Riley Keough, Peter Sarsgaard</p>\n<p class=\"c-end-para\" id=\"62HXmt\">If you’re looking for another unhinged, nail-biting Jake Gyllenhaal performance similar to 2014’s <em>Nightcrawler</em>, Antoine Fuqua’s 2021 crime thriller is the movie for you. Written by Nic Pizzolatto of <em>True Detective</em> fame, this American remake of the 2018 Danish film of the same name stars Gyllenhaal in this one-man drama as Joe Baylor, an LAPD officer working a probationary night shift at a 911 call center in the lead-up to an undisclosed court hearing. When Joe receives an emergency call from a kidnapped woman, he frantically works to track down the culprit in his personal bid for redemption. But not everything is as it seems, and Joe will have to face not only the truth of the situation but also himself if he has any shot of setting things right. Powered by an impeccably magnetic lead performance, <em>The Guilty</em> is a solid and entertaining thriller worth watching. <em>—TE</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"yTnrza\"></h2>\n\n",

If you’re looking for a murder mystery drama/slow-burn cerebral home invasion thriller with unsettling found-footage elements à la Michael Haneke’s <em>Caché</em>, <em>I See You</em> is the perfect choice. <em>—Toussaint Egan</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"zPh083\"><strong>Psycho</strong></h2>\n<div class=\"c-wide-block\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"A woman (Janet Leigh) behind the wheel of an automobile in Psycho.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_Yud2oEY57Zr4F8aFjr6DHvt7ww=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24565949/11__844_.jpg\">\n      <cite>Image: Universal Pictures Home Entertainment</cite>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n<p id=\"pJY3Be\"><strong>Year: </strong>1960<br><strong>Run time: </strong>1h 49m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Alfred Hitchcock<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles, John Gavin</p>\n<p id=\"rj4N3V\">What could possibly be said about Alfred Hitchcock’s 1960 psychological horror thriller that hasn’t already been said before several times over? <em>Psycho</em> is an undisputed masterpiece, the crown jewel in a filmography of a director with no shortage of cinematic gems, a film so iconic and widely referenced and parodied by countless other films and television series, the thought that anyone could go without recognizing it feels all but impossible. </p>\n<p id=\"x7WTLm\">The film stars Vera Miles and John Gavin as Lila Crane and Sam Loomis, the sister and lover respectively of Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), a would-be embezzler on the run after stealing $40,000 from her job as a bank teller. Investigating her disappearance, Lila and Sam track Marion’s last-known whereabouts to a motel run by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and his mother. To say anything more would be to spoil the plot. If you somehow have never seen or heard about <em>Psycho</em>, stop what you’re doing and make it your priority to watch this film. <em>—TE</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"TOOLdS\"><strong>Side Effects</strong></h2>\n<div class=\"c-wide-block\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aQJUetnVQ1GADtBsxB33F0T2oek=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24559825/side_effects_jude_law.jpg\">\n      <cite>Image: Endgame Entertainment/Open Road Films</cite>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n<p id=\"pkoYEI\"><strong>Year:</strong> 2013<br><strong>Run time:</strong> 1h 46m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Steven Soderbergh<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Rooney Mara, Jude Law, Channing Tatum</p>\n<p id=\"xeg7KZ\">Now, from a Hitchcock classic to a Hitchcock-inspired modern classic.</p>\n<p id=\"NlTQ5A\">Before making movies with his iPhone, and before his “retirement” from directing, Steven Soderbergh made this captivating psychological thriller about the pharmaceutical industry, written by his frequent collaborator Scott Z. Burns (<em>Contagion</em>). </p>\n<p id=\"ShzjcA\">In<em> Side Effects</em>, Emily (Rooney Mara) a wealthy woman whose husband (Channing Tatum) recently got out of prison after a bid for insider trading. After attempting to take her own life, Emily is prescribed an experimental drug by a pair of psychiatrists (Jude Law and Catherine Zeta-Jones), with shocking... side effects.</p>\n<p id=\"McJgoE\">Soderbergh’s most Hitchcockian movie (at least until <em>Kimi</em>), <em>Side Effects</em> is a clever thriller with great central performances (especially Mara, who is fantastic in a great addition to the “a person has an extremely bad time” film canon) and plenty of twists to keep viewers guessing. It’s also the kind of movie that rewards rewatches — if you’ve already seen it, now’s a good opportunity to revisit it. —<em>PV</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"91ZFiP\"><strong>The Guilty</strong></h2>\n<div class=\"c-wide-block\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"JAKE GYLLENHAAL with a headset at a 9-1-1 computer bay in The Guilty\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d3VmROJki21OVFlxXUYSjLAwHWg=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22891221/The_Guilty_00_06_53_12_R.jpg\">\n      <cite>Image: Netflix</cite>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n<p id=\"OIhuvq\"><strong>Year:</strong> 2021<br><strong>Run time:</strong> 1h 30m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Antoine Fuqua<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Jake Gyllenhaal, Riley Keough, Peter Sarsgaard</p>\n<p class=\"c-end-para\" id=\"62HXmt\">If you’re looking for another unhinged, nail-biting Jake Gyllenhaal performance similar to 2014’s <em>Nightcrawler</em>, Antoine Fuqua’s 2021 crime thriller is the movie for you. Written by Nic Pizzolatto of <em>True Detective</em> fame, this American remake of the 2018 Danish film of the same name stars Gyllenhaal in this one-man drama as Joe Baylor, an LAPD officer working a probationary night shift at a 911 call center in the lead-up to an undisclosed court hearing. When Joe receives an emergency call from a kidnapped woman, he frantically works to track down the culprit in his personal bid for redemption. But not everything is as it seems, and Joe will have to face not only the truth of the situation but also himself if he has any shot of setting things right. Powered by an impeccably magnetic lead performance, <em>The Guilty</em> is a solid and entertaining thriller worth watching. <em>—TE</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"yTnrza\"></h2>\n\n",

It’s undignified. It’s commercial. It’s very, very silly.</p>\n<p id=\"rVbS0w\">But that’s a big part of the reason why it’s so much fun to watch. His commitment to the bit so clearly crosses the line from “contractual studio promo obligation” into “adult at play.” His utterly shameless energy is an open invitation for Very Serious Adults to feel like kids again, to embrace this kind of egoless goofery around whatever still sparks joy in their lives. It characterizes pretty much all his appearances on social media these days, not just <em>Super Mario Bros. Movie</em>-related ones. And it’s refreshing and kind of adorable.</p>\n<p id=\"4a2Ipz\">So if you’re willing to risk spending the next several days with Bowser’s song “Peaches” stuck in your head, dive into Black’s latest celebration of silliness, as he sings the song while wearing yet another Bowser-respecting costume, banging on a peach-colored piano in a mockup of a giant mushroom-shaped room, and ultimately flinging himself onto the floor to just really shout it all out. May the rest of us all someday get the chance to love something the way Jack Black loves emoting.</p>\n<div id=\"13q702\">\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CqWXL5yPzLs/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

It’s undignified. It’s commercial. It’s very, very silly.</p>\n<p id=\"rVbS0w\">But that’s a big part of the reason why it’s so much fun to watch. His commitment to the bit so clearly crosses the line from “contractual studio promo obligation” into “adult at play.” His utterly shameless energy is an open invitation for Very Serious Adults to feel like kids again, to embrace this kind of egoless goofery around whatever still sparks joy in their lives. It characterizes pretty much all his appearances on social media these days, not just <em>Super Mario Bros. Movie</em>-related ones. And it’s refreshing and kind of adorable.</p>\n<p id=\"4a2Ipz\">So if you’re willing to risk spending the next several days with Bowser’s song “Peaches” stuck in your head, dive into Black’s latest celebration of silliness, as he sings the song while wearing yet another Bowser-respecting costume, banging on a peach-colored piano in a mockup of a giant mushroom-shaped room, and ultimately flinging himself onto the floor to just really shout it all out. May the rest of us all someday get the chance to love something the way Jack Black loves emoting.</p>\n<div id=\"13q702\">\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CqWXL5yPzLs/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Through this contemplation, this wrestling with intent and perspective, art illuminates the human condition, and perhaps allows an aficionado to grow and develop as a person. Movies are also a great way to spend a couple hours with a <em>complete</em> asshole and be delighted, instead of having it ruin your day. </p>\n<p id=\"RSTGnC\"><em>Air</em>, the new film about the creation of Nike’s Air Jordan line of sneakers, features one of the best movie assholes you’re likely to see this year. It’s a sports business movie, the perfect forum for showcasing assholes, and it’ll be hard to top Chris Messina’s performance as the volatile agent David Falk. </p>\n<p id=\"YzQT2l\">Falk is the real-life sports agent who represented Michael Jordan at the start of his career, when he was a promising but unproven player for University of North Carolina’s basketball team and about to join the Chicago Bulls. The real David Falk has a storied career that may or may not have involved him being a complete prick, but the David Falk in <em>Air</em> is an absolutely delightful jerk who lights up the screen whenever he shows up to swear into a telephone. </p>\n<div class=\"c-wide-block\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Chris Messina as David Falk sits in a corporate meeting room in a grey suit in the film Air.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-F3v6aHiFSN4EtneLo9KNLo8YvI=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24570255/SMAN_2023_UT_220630_CARANA_13222RC_3000.jpg\">\n      <cite>Photo: Ana Carballosa/Amazon Studios</cite>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n<p id=\"kY8uBV\">As Falk, Chris Messina (whom viewers may know from <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2020/2/5/21114321/birds-of-prey-review-harley-quinn-margot-robbie\"><em>Birds of Prey</em></a> or <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/tv/2018/12/14/18138373/best-tv-2018-new-shows\"><em>Sharp Objects</em></a>) is <em>Air</em>’s de facto antagonist, a brick wall for the movie’s hero, Nike talent scout Sonny Vaccaro (Matt Damon) to throw himself against. Sonny is trying to land Jordan as a sponsor for the 1984 version of Nike, which is far from the sports-sneaker behemoth it is today. <em>Air </em>portrays Vaccaro as an “athletes are magical” true believer stuck in a marketing department full of people just trying to keep the company in the black. It follows him as he tries to convince everyone to embrace the radical-in-1984 idea of putting the company’s entire weight behind one athlete, and designing a shoe that can be branded with his name. </p>\n<p id=\"R02EBs\">One person <em>Air</em> does not feature is Jordan himself. Vaccaro instead has to contend with people who represent Jordan, like Falk and, later, Jordan’s mother, Deloris (Viola Davis). This is <em>Air</em>’s <a href=\"https://lwlies.com/articles/air-michael-jordan-ben-affleck/\">most divisive aspect</a>, as the wheeling and dealing between Vaccaro, Falk, and others centers around the idea of labor, and how much that labor is worth to the worker and the corporation eager to exploit it. A cursory viewing of <em>Air</em> would see the film as corporate propaganda, a hagiography of wealthy marketers and executives securing their legacies off the back of the most legendary basketball player in the history of the game. Or, arguably, it could be seen as a played-out paean to guys like Vaccaro (movies like this almost <em>exclusively</em> celebrate guys) who go with their gut and are met with unprecedented success, in spite of all the doubters around them who rightly say they’re being reckless. </p>\n<p id=\"IGE4DR\">But <em>Air</em> might be about something more complicated than that. For all Falk’s bluster in representing Jordan — and truly, Messina does a fantastic job of blustering, wearing the phones he shouts into about as well as his impeccably tailored suits — he doesn’t know what he has in his client. To Falk, and nearly every other character in <em>Air</em> apart from Sonny Vaccaro and Deloris Jordan, Michael Jordan is just a paycheck, numbers on a balance sheet that may or may not work out for them. That uncertainty pervades <em>Air</em>, offering up a bit of on-the-nose irony that director Ben Affleck makes a meal of. At every moment, he plays up the irony of the audience knowing his characters are debating the viability and profitability of the most famous basketball player alive. </p>\n<div class=\"c-wide-block\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Three men, including Matt Damon and Jason Bateman, star at a shoe prototype in Nike’s lab in the film Air.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K-61qg5mzVAhhmb0Mi4idAgmHDs=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24570269/SMAN_UT_00089RC__2__3000.jpg\">\n      <cite>Photo: Ana Carballosa/Amazon Studios</cite>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n<p id=\"WhTVeI\">While all these characters are debating what athletes should be paid for their labor, <em>Air</em> breezily juxtaposes its conflicts against the era’s massive commercial successes. Pop hits from Bonnie Tyler and Run-DMC constantly filter through the soundtrack. Brand names pepper the screen, and era-appropriate commercials are constantly sampled. First-time screenwriter Alex Convery presents a vision of corporate-driven monoculture at the height of its last great era, just as it was about to discover one of its final figureheads. <em>Air</em> is a movie about how hard it is to make a hit <em>anything</em>, and an elegiac tune for a present-day pop-culture landscape where nothing is ever likely to land as hard as the 1980s’ major touchstones again. </p>\n<p id=\"m6OSr8\">What makes this movie so striking is the way every character in <em>Air </em>who isn’t named “Jordan” is just guessing. David Falk is an asshole because he’s decided that the only way to get results is to treat every client as an excuse to shake people down for money, so he can increase his personal clout and wealth. While Sonny Vaccaro eventually wins the day, he spends much of <em>Air</em>’s run time as an inveterate gambler in Jerry Maguire<em> </em>mode, forever a day away from washing out, neglecting his health and personal life to chase hunches that, he’s repeatedly told, have never panned out. </p>\n<p id=\"77pb5V\">For 112 minutes, white men with money are depicted spending much of their time convincing themselves and others that they can spot where the culture is going, when it’s clear they can’t, because their primary mandate is safeguarding their wealth. In his least sympathetic moment, Vaccaro squirms at Deloris’ confident negotiations to get Michael part of the gross sales on the shoes bearing his name. He knows that just isn’t how things are done. In the sneaker business of the era, athletes are paid a licensing fee for their endorsement, and the profits are for the company — which the execs argue is the true source of value.</p>\n<div class=\"c-wide-block\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Matt Damon’s Sonny Vaccaro sits across from Viola Davis’ Deloris Jordan at a backyard picnic table in the film Air.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WenuFD2sNzHjU04HsKaXSIdKu54=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24570276/SMAN_2023_FG_00435809_Still257R__2__3000.jpg\">\n      <cite>Image: Amazon Studios</cite>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n<p id=\"WZVJL2\">Vaccaro is blindly loyal to the precedent of this inequitable structure, and he balks at the thought of upending it — even telling Nike CEO Phil Knight (Affleck himself) that he lost the Jordan deal. Vaccaro is surprised when Knight takes Deloris’ condition seriously, and in a moment of fourth-wall-breaking irony, Knight later muses that he may have set a precedent that upends the industry. </p>\n<p id=\"uS74kz\">Through impassioned arguments and off-the-cuff speeches, <em>Air</em> shows the process by which corporations graft themselves onto culture, as genuine faith and magic collide with the machinery of commerce, and the exploitation by which it thrives. It’s a meat grinder built primarily to benefit men like David Falk and Phil Knight, and any windfall gained by the young Michael Jordans of the world is secondary at best. Men with money arm themselves with bluster and confidence as they fumble in the dark, trying to hitch their wagons to someone that does something that makes the people of the world feel like they believe in something again. </p>\n<p class=\"c-end-para\" id=\"Vq1g0J\"><em>Air </em>ultimately condemns Falk — at least as much as it’s capable of condemning anyone — by making the character almost wholly extraneous to the history the film adapts. It’s Sonny Vaccaro and Deloris Jordan, the movie’s true believers, who move the needle and marry Nike’s corporate success to Michael Jordan’s incredible career. As a tremendous asshole, Falk makes for a great scapegoat, but he’s also an honest asshole; Deloris is the only character in the film who isn’t trying to exploit Michael. Ultimately, they’re all assholes whose careers depend on people not knowing what they’re worth. </p>\n<p id=\"AnJ8I7\"><small><em>Air</em></small><small> is playing in theaters now. </small></p>\n\n",

The real David Falk has a storied career that may or may not have involved him being a complete prick, but the David Falk in <em>Air</em> is an absolutely delightful jerk who lights up the screen whenever he shows up to swear into a telephone. </p>\n<div class=\"c-wide-block\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Chris Messina as David Falk sits in a corporate meeting room in a grey suit in the film Air.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-F3v6aHiFSN4EtneLo9KNLo8YvI=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24570255/SMAN_2023_UT_220630_CARANA_13222RC_3000.jpg\">\n      <cite>Photo: Ana Carballosa/Amazon Studios</cite>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n<p id=\"kY8uBV\">As Falk, Chris Messina (whom viewers may know from <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2020/2/5/21114321/birds-of-prey-review-harley-quinn-margot-robbie\"><em>Birds of Prey</em></a> or <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/tv/2018/12/14/18138373/best-tv-2018-new-shows\"><em>Sharp Objects</em></a>) is <em>Air</em>’s de facto antagonist, a brick wall for the movie’s hero, Nike talent scout Sonny Vaccaro (Matt Damon) to throw himself against. Sonny is trying to land Jordan as a sponsor for the 1984 version of Nike, which is far from the sports-sneaker behemoth it is today. <em>Air </em>portrays Vaccaro as an “athletes are magical” true believer stuck in a marketing department full of people just trying to keep the company in the black. It follows him as he tries to convince everyone to embrace the radical-in-1984 idea of putting the company’s entire weight behind one athlete, and designing a shoe that can be branded with his name. </p>\n<p id=\"R02EBs\">One person <em>Air</em> does not feature is Jordan himself. Vaccaro instead has to contend with people who represent Jordan, like Falk and, later, Jordan’s mother, Deloris (Viola Davis). This is <em>Air</em>’s <a href=\"https://lwlies.com/articles/air-michael-jordan-ben-affleck/\">most divisive aspect</a>, as the wheeling and dealing between Vaccaro, Falk, and others centers around the idea of labor, and how much that labor is worth to the worker and the corporation eager to exploit it. A cursory viewing of <em>Air</em> would see the film as corporate propaganda, a hagiography of wealthy marketers and executives securing their legacies off the back of the most legendary basketball player in the history of the game. Or, arguably, it could be seen as a played-out paean to guys like Vaccaro (movies like this almost <em>exclusively</em> celebrate guys) who go with their gut and are met with unprecedented success, in spite of all the doubters around them who rightly say they’re being reckless. </p>\n<p id=\"IGE4DR\">But <em>Air</em> might be about something more complicated than that. For all Falk’s bluster in representing Jordan — and truly, Messina does a fantastic job of blustering, wearing the phones he shouts into about as well as his impeccably tailored suits — he doesn’t know what he has in his client. To Falk, and nearly every other character in <em>Air</em> apart from Sonny Vaccaro and Deloris Jordan, Michael Jordan is just a paycheck, numbers on a balance sheet that may or may not work out for them. That uncertainty pervades <em>Air</em>, offering up a bit of on-the-nose irony that director Ben Affleck makes a meal of. At every moment, he plays up the irony of the audience knowing his characters are debating the viability and profitability of the most famous basketball player alive. </p>\n<div class=\"c-wide-block\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Three men, including Matt Damon and Jason Bateman, star at a shoe prototype in Nike’s lab in the film Air.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K-61qg5mzVAhhmb0Mi4idAgmHDs=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24570269/SMAN_UT_00089RC__2__3000.jpg\">\n      <cite>Photo: Ana Carballosa/Amazon Studios</cite>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n<p id=\"WhTVeI\">While all these characters are debating what athletes should be paid for their labor, <em>Air</em> breezily juxtaposes its conflicts against the era’s massive commercial successes. Pop hits from Bonnie Tyler and Run-DMC constantly filter through the soundtrack. Brand names pepper the screen, and era-appropriate commercials are constantly sampled. First-time screenwriter Alex Convery presents a vision of corporate-driven monoculture at the height of its last great era, just as it was about to discover one of its final figureheads. <em>Air</em> is a movie about how hard it is to make a hit <em>anything</em>, and an elegiac tune for a present-day pop-culture landscape where nothing is ever likely to land as hard as the 1980s’ major touchstones again. </p>\n<p id=\"m6OSr8\">What makes this movie so striking is the way every character in <em>Air </em>who isn’t named “Jordan” is just guessing. David Falk is an asshole because he’s decided that the only way to get results is to treat every client as an excuse to shake people down for money, so he can increase his personal clout and wealth. While Sonny Vaccaro eventually wins the day, he spends much of <em>Air</em>’s run time as an inveterate gambler in Jerry Maguire<em> </em>mode, forever a day away from washing out, neglecting his health and personal life to chase hunches that, he’s repeatedly told, have never panned out. </p>\n<p id=\"77pb5V\">For 112 minutes, white men with money are depicted spending much of their time convincing themselves and others that they can spot where the culture is going, when it’s clear they can’t, because their primary mandate is safeguarding their wealth. In his least sympathetic moment, Vaccaro squirms at Deloris’ confident negotiations to get Michael part of the gross sales on the shoes bearing his name. He knows that just isn’t how things are done. In the sneaker business of the era, athletes are paid a licensing fee for their endorsement, and the profits are for the company — which the execs argue is the true source of value.</p>\n<div class=\"c-wide-block\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Matt Damon’s Sonny Vaccaro sits across from Viola Davis’ Deloris Jordan at a backyard picnic table in the film Air.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WenuFD2sNzHjU04HsKaXSIdKu54=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24570276/SMAN_2023_FG_00435809_Still257R__2__3000.jpg\">\n      <cite>Image: Amazon Studios</cite>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n<p id=\"WZVJL2\">Vaccaro is blindly loyal to the precedent of this inequitable structure, and he balks at the thought of upending it — even telling Nike CEO Phil Knight (Affleck himself) that he lost the Jordan deal. Vaccaro is surprised when Knight takes Deloris’ condition seriously, and in a moment of fourth-wall-breaking irony, Knight later muses that he may have set a precedent that upends the industry. </p>\n<p id=\"uS74kz\">Through impassioned arguments and off-the-cuff speeches, <em>Air</em> shows the process by which corporations graft themselves onto culture, as genuine faith and magic collide with the machinery of commerce, and the exploitation by which it thrives. It’s a meat grinder built primarily to benefit men like David Falk and Phil Knight, and any windfall gained by the young Michael Jordans of the world is secondary at best. Men with money arm themselves with bluster and confidence as they fumble in the dark, trying to hitch their wagons to someone that does something that makes the people of the world feel like they believe in something again. </p>\n<p class=\"c-end-para\" id=\"Vq1g0J\"><em>Air </em>ultimately condemns Falk — at least as much as it’s capable of condemning anyone — by making the character almost wholly extraneous to the history the film adapts. It’s Sonny Vaccaro and Deloris Jordan, the movie’s true believers, who move the needle and marry Nike’s corporate success to Michael Jordan’s incredible career. As a tremendous asshole, Falk makes for a great scapegoat, but he’s also an honest asshole; Deloris is the only character in the film who isn’t trying to exploit Michael. Ultimately, they’re all assholes whose careers depend on people not knowing what they’re worth. </p>\n<p id=\"AnJ8I7\"><small><em>Air</em></small><small> is playing in theaters now. </small></p>\n\n",

Instead, it<em> </em>creates a distance from the audience by positioning its violence as performative. It makes all that brutality more palatable than it might have been otherwise. In their handmade effects and their evocation of iconic slashers, the Terrifier<em> </em>films let horror fans indulge in the warm comfort of nostalgia while still playing to our latent desire for the thrill of a film that’s able to pull the blood-soaked rug out from under us. </p></blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"TKOs39\"><strong>On a Wing and a Prayer</strong></h3>\n<p id=\"3V9GRz\"><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Available to stream on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Wing-Prayer-Dennis-Quaid/dp/B0B75XQBGB/ref=sr_1_1?tag=polygon05-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Prime Video</a></p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"(L-R) Dennis Quaid and Heather Graham seated behind the controls of a plane in On a Wing and a Prayer.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ymkv4cF9fyF6z5fDh612u7UyFvg=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24560368/1200x0.jpg\">\n      <cite>Image: MGM</cite>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"JN6GBN\"><strong>Genre:</strong> Survival drama<br><strong>Run time: </strong>1h 42m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Sean McNamara<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Dennis Quaid, Heather Graham, Jesse Metcalfe</p>\n<p id=\"TRsD2M\">Dennis Quaid (<em>The Day After Tomorrow</em>) and Heather Graham (<em>Boogie Nights</em>) star in this survival drama as Doug White, a 56-year-old pharmacist, and his wife, Terri.

Instead, it<em> </em>creates a distance from the audience by positioning its violence as performative. It makes all that brutality more palatable than it might have been otherwise. In their handmade effects and their evocation of iconic slashers, the Terrifier<em> </em>films let horror fans indulge in the warm comfort of nostalgia while still playing to our latent desire for the thrill of a film that’s able to pull the blood-soaked rug out from under us. </p></blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"TKOs39\"><strong>On a Wing and a Prayer</strong></h3>\n<p id=\"3V9GRz\"><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Available to stream on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Wing-Prayer-Dennis-Quaid/dp/B0B75XQBGB/ref=sr_1_1?tag=polygon05-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Prime Video</a></p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"(L-R) Dennis Quaid and Heather Graham seated behind the controls of a plane in On a Wing and a Prayer.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ymkv4cF9fyF6z5fDh612u7UyFvg=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24560368/1200x0.jpg\">\n      <cite>Image: MGM</cite>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"JN6GBN\"><strong>Genre:</strong> Survival drama<br><strong>Run time: </strong>1h 42m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Sean McNamara<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Dennis Quaid, Heather Graham, Jesse Metcalfe</p>\n<p id=\"TRsD2M\">Dennis Quaid (<em>The Day After Tomorrow</em>) and Heather Graham (<em>Boogie Nights</em>) star in this survival drama as Doug White, a 56-year-old pharmacist, and his wife, Terri.

The replayable, high score-focused mode returns from the original <em>RE4</em>, throwing Leon S. Kennedy (and other playable characters) against waves of enemies.</p>\n<p id=\"oE7C2D\">But that’s not the only addition to <em>Resident Evil</em><em> 4</em>. Capcom has added a handful of new microtransactions to digital stores, letting players spend cold hard cash on upgrade tickets for in-game weapons. In <em>Resident Evil</em><em> 4</em>, these tickets can be purchased with Spinels, the collectible currency that players earn largely by completing missions called requests. (Normally, earning a weapon’s exclusive upgrade requires fully levelling up all of its stats, but an exclusive upgrade ticket will let you bypass that restriction.) But if completing The Merchant’s various fetch quests and assassinations is too laborious for you, Capcom will also gladly accept $2.99 for a weapon exclusive upgrade ticket.</p>\n<p id=\"appHubAppName\">Capcom is now selling a variety of weapon exclusive upgrade tickets — somewhat confusingly named things like <em>Resident Evil 4</em> Weapon Exclusive Upgrade Ticket x1 (A), <em>Resident Evil 4</em> Weapon Exclusive Upgrade Ticket x1 (B), etc. — in various bundle sizes.

The replayable, high score-focused mode returns from the original <em>RE4</em>, throwing Leon S. Kennedy (and other playable characters) against waves of enemies.</p>\n<p id=\"oE7C2D\">But that’s not the only addition to <em>Resident Evil</em><em> 4</em>. Capcom has added a handful of new microtransactions to digital stores, letting players spend cold hard cash on upgrade tickets for in-game weapons. In <em>Resident Evil</em><em> 4</em>, these tickets can be purchased with Spinels, the collectible currency that players earn largely by completing missions called requests. (Normally, earning a weapon’s exclusive upgrade requires fully levelling up all of its stats, but an exclusive upgrade ticket will let you bypass that restriction.) But if completing The Merchant’s various fetch quests and assassinations is too laborious for you, Capcom will also gladly accept $2.99 for a weapon exclusive upgrade ticket.</p>\n<p id=\"appHubAppName\">Capcom is now selling a variety of weapon exclusive upgrade tickets — somewhat confusingly named things like <em>Resident Evil 4</em> Weapon Exclusive Upgrade Ticket x1 (A), <em>Resident Evil 4</em> Weapon Exclusive Upgrade Ticket x1 (B), etc. — in various bundle sizes. An individual ticket costs $2.99, while a <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2197324/Resident_Evil_4_Weapon_Exclusive_Upgrade_Ticket_x3_A/\">three-pack costs $6.99</a> and a <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2197328/Resident_Evil_4_Weapon_Exclusive_Upgrade_Ticket_x5_A/\">five-pack costs $9.99</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"dqMAcu\">These types of microtransactions have been par for the course in Capcom’s most recent Resident Evil games. <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/game/resident-evil-8-village/40677\"><em>Resident Evil Village</em></a>’s microtransactions include a 99 cent <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1456363/Resident_Evil_Village__Survival_Resources_Pack/\">Survival Resources Pack</a> that grants the player ammo, healing items, and lockpicks; and a paid unlock that <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1456361/Resident_Evil_Village__Extra_Content_Shop_All_Access_Voucher/\">grants access to extra content in the game’s shop</a>.

The novel and its two sequels which — later known as the Thrawn trilogy — took place shortly after the events of <em>Return of the Jedi</em>. Zahn’s books filled readers in on what happened to the Galactic Empire in the years after the death of Darth Vader and <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2019/12/19/21030344/how-is-emperor-palpatine-alive-in-star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-snoke-kylo-rey-vader-spoilers\">supposed death</a> of Emperor Palpatine. As it turns out, Thrawn happened.</p>\n<p id=\"HV120S\">While that original trilogy of novels was decanonized when Disney bought the Star Wars franchise, Thrawn was reintroduced in <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/2020/11/13/21563830/the-mandalorian-s2-e3-koska-reeves-sasha-banks-bo-katan-kryze-actors-new-characters\"><em>Star Wars: Rebels</em></a>, and given a series of <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/2020/9/3/21408128/star-wars-books-thrawn-ascendency-chaos-rising-timothy-zahn-interview-thrawn-trilogy\">new novels also penned by Zahn</a>.

While on-board Thrawn’s command ship the Chimaera, Ezra catches Thrawn off guard by attacking his fleet of ships with <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/23620250/mandalorian-purrgil-hyperspace-whales-star-wars-ahsoka-ezra-thrawn\">purrgil</a>, giant tentacled creatures capable of hyperspace travel. In the final moments of the show, Thrawn and Bridger are both aboard the Chimaera when the purrgil whisk it off into deep space. Apparently both of them survive the journey, which is probably how we get to Thrawn’s mention in <em>The Mandalorian</em>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ZvbYlq\"><strong>What is Thrawn’s role in The Mandalorian and Ahsoka?</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"DNuxvT\">In season 2 episode 5 of <em>The Mandalorian</em>, called “The Jedi,” Din Djarin and Grogu head to the planet of Corvus and meet former-Jedi Ahsoka Tano. In the episode, Tano explains that she’s tracking down someone that Thrawn took under his wing in a search for the Grand Admiral’s current whereabouts. </p>\n<p id=\"XdfRcH\">While she doesn’t explain exactly why she wants to find Thrawn, it’s likely that it has something to do with the whereabouts of Ezra Bridger. Tano’s last appearance in a Star Wars series before this was at the end of <em>Rebels</em>, when she and the Mandalorian warrior Sabine Wren were setting off to find Bridger. Whatever the reason is, it seems that Ahsoka’s quest for Thrawn will play an important role in the plot of her Disney Plus series.</p>\n<p id=\"Zob92B\">The first trailer for <em>Ahsoka</em> makes this even more clear, by letting us know that Thrawn is back and working to rebuild the Empire — and maybe even revive Palpatine himself. </p>\n<h2 id=\"GishHc\"><strong>Who’s going to play Grand Admiral Thrawn?</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"OttuVs\">This is probably the biggest outstanding question about Thrawn’s place in Disney’s Star Wars universe. Thrawn voice actor Lars Mikkelsen has said that he isn’t playing the character in live-action, and though people have fibbed about their roles in blockbusters before, that leaves the door open for all kinds of choices. Disney could opt for a beloved character actor to fill the role, or it could go the <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/23671150/mandalorian-lizzo-jack-black-christopher-lloyd-season-3-cameos\">stunt-casting route and pick someone ultra-famous</a>. But for now, we’ll just have to wait and see what direction Disney chooses to go. </p>\n<p id=\"Wsl7Q6\">As for his role in the story itself, it’s still anyone’s guess where Thrawn’s plot will go, and how it will tie into the Empire, the First Order, or even the stories of Ezra and Sabine, but the good news is we won’t have to wait long to find out. Thrawn’s return to Star Wars, and his live-action debut, aren’t far away. <em>Ahsoka</em> is set to be released this summer on Disney Plus. </p>\n\n",

Tano’s last appearance in a Star Wars series before this was at the end of <em>Rebels</em>, when she and the Mandalorian warrior Sabine Wren were setting off to find Bridger. Whatever the reason is, it seems that Ahsoka’s quest for Thrawn will play an important role in the plot of her Disney Plus series.</p>\n<p id=\"Zob92B\">The first trailer for <em>Ahsoka</em> makes this even more clear, by letting us know that Thrawn is back and working to rebuild the Empire — and maybe even revive Palpatine himself. </p>\n<h2 id=\"GishHc\"><strong>Who’s going to play Grand Admiral Thrawn?</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"OttuVs\">This is probably the biggest outstanding question about Thrawn’s place in Disney’s Star Wars universe. Thrawn voice actor Lars Mikkelsen has said that he isn’t playing the character in live-action, and though people have fibbed about their roles in blockbusters before, that leaves the door open for all kinds of choices. Disney could opt for a beloved character actor to fill the role, or it could go the <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/23671150/mandalorian-lizzo-jack-black-christopher-lloyd-season-3-cameos\">stunt-casting route and pick someone ultra-famous</a>. But for now, we’ll just have to wait and see what direction Disney chooses to go. </p>\n<p id=\"Wsl7Q6\">As for his role in the story itself, it’s still anyone’s guess where Thrawn’s plot will go, and how it will tie into the Empire, the First Order, or even the stories of Ezra and Sabine, but the good news is we won’t have to wait long to find out. Thrawn’s return to Star Wars, and his live-action debut, aren’t far away. <em>Ahsoka</em> is set to be released this summer on Disney Plus. </p>\n\n",
