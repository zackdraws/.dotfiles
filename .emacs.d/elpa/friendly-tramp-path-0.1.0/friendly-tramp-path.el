;; More friendly (permissive) TRAMP path constructions for us humans.
;;
;; Provides function `friendly-tramp-path-disect` that is a drop-in replacement
;; for `tramp-dissect-file-name`. It behaves the same but allows the following
;; formats:
;;
;;  - `/<method>:[<user>[%<domain>]@]<host>[%<port>][:<localname>]` (regular TRAMP format)
;;  - `[<user>[%<domain>]@]<host>[%<port>][:<localname>]` (permissive format)
;;
;; For detailed instructions, please look at the README.md at https://github.com/p3r7/friendly-tramp-path/blob/master/README.md
